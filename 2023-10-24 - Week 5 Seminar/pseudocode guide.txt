- A variable declaration v = x : T introduces a variable v of type T and initialises it
with value x.

- a : Array [i..j] of T introduces an array a consisting of j−i+1 elements of
type T stored in a[i], a[i+1], …, a[j]. At this stage of the module, a string
is considered an array of characters and a list is an dynamic array where we can
append value at the end of the list.

- The simplest statement is an assignment x := E where x is a variable and E is an
expression.

- Flow-control structure are given below

if condition then
    statements
else if condition then
    statements
else
    statements
endif

while condition do
    statements
endwhile

for i:= 1 to n do
    statements
endfor

foreach e in collection do
    statements
endforeach

Functions (returns a value) and Procedures (does not return a value) are written as follows:

Function name(param1: Type1, Param2:Type2, …): returnedType
    statements

Procedure name(param1: Type1, Param2:Type2, …)
    statements
